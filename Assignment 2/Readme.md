Spam Classifier using the following 2 methods:

   1. Basic Version - Using Support Vector Classifier under SVM and GridSearchCV
   2. Advanced Version - Using LSTM and Embeddings
    
    Note: Advanced version will take a lot of time to train even on Google Colab but will be able to get more higher accuracy than that of Basic model, even though basic model's       accuracy reaches as high as 98.77%
